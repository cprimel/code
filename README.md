# Introduction

Here you will find snippets of code and notes that I have saved for future reference. It is an extension of [my wiki](https://wiki.cprimel.io). 

# Navigating
This resource is organized by language or tool to facilitate all of those last minute "How do I do X in Y?" questions that arise when jumping between different environments and tools. It is also possible to use GitBooks built-in search function which you can find in the upperleft corner of the page.
